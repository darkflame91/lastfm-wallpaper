# lastfm-wallpaper
This is a simple script with the intention of dynamically changing the wallpaper with the details of the currently playing track.
I use a monitor with a transparent terminal, and the intention is to have the script changing the background according to the track.
Currently working on this for CentOS 7. All testing, unless otherwise specified will be on this platform.
